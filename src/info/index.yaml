title: Derpibooru API
version: 0.0.1
description: |
  Unofficial api documentation for [https://derpibooru.org](https://derpibooru.org).

  ## From the official docs:
  > ### API
  > Derpibooru provides a JSON API for major site functionality, which can be freely used by anyone wanting to produce tools for the site or other webapps that use the data provided within Derpibooru.
  > ### Licensing
  > Licensing of the API is simple - anyone can use it, users making abusively high numbers of requests may be asked to stop. Your application MUST properly cache, respect server-side cache expiry times. Your client MUST gracefully back off if requests fail (eg non-200 HTTP code), preferably exponentially or fatally.
  >
  > Credit MUST always be given to the site in the form of a link. If images are used, the artist MUST always be credited (if provided) and the original source URL MUST be displayed alongside the image, either in textual form or as a link. A link to the Derpibooru page is optional but recommended; we recommend the derpibooru.org domain as a canonical domain. The https protocol MUST be specified on all URIs; Derpibooru does not support plaintext HTTP connections.
  >
  > ### Accessing the API
  > Most methods support API access by appending the extension .json to a URL. For requests that require authentication, the URL parameter "key" should be appended. This key provides limited access to a user's account. This key can be found by users on their account page. For instance, to access a user"s watched feed, the request /images/watched.json?key=-Od-dTiwcf9dN2djrhlN would be made.
  >
  > Methods dealing with large feeds are paginated; the "page" parameter controls the page you're on. The number of images per page can be set with the "perpage" parameter. The default is 15 unless you use your key and have changed the "Images per page" option on the settings page.
  >
  > Search endpoints are controlled by the current user's filter (or the default, if no key is supplied); if you wish to use a custom filter, you can use the "filter_id" parameter.

  ## Overview

  ### Endpoints v1
  Derpibooru's API v1 endpoints are the same as normal pages. You can get API data from MOST pages by appending `.json` to the URL or adding an `Accept: application/json` HTTP header to your request. For example: To get the data for image 1 ([https://derpibooru.org/1](https://derpibooru.org/1)), you would make a request to [https://derpibooru.org/1.json](https://derpibooru.org/1.json).

  ### Endpoints v2
  A few years ago, v2 of the API started showing up, using a semi-standard url structure: `/api/v2/{entity}/{endpoint}.json`. It's never been documented and is still pretty inconsistent.

  ### Authentication
  There are two ways to authenticate: Using a session cookie or using an api key. Changes made using a session cookie also require a csrf token. To use an api key, simply add it using the `key` url parameter. The api key can be found on a user's account settings page (https://derpibooru.org/users/edit). **Be sure to keep your key a secret - It can be used to login as you and the only way of changing it is to ask for it to be manually reset [[ref1]](https://derpibooru.org/meta/quick-question-about-apis-and-login/post/2636861#post_2636861) [[ref2]](https://derpibooru.org/meta/derpibooru-dl-stopped-working-possible-change-in-how-api-results-are-returned/post/3628439#post_3628439)**

  ### Filters
  All image searches are limited by the current filter. Authenticated requests will always use the currently selected filter for that user. Unauthenticated requests will default to the "default" filter, but a different one can be chosen by using the `filter_id` URL Parameter. You can use any filter with this parameter - even ones that aren't public.

  ### Pagination
  Many results on Derpibooru are paginated. The `page` URL Parameter can be used to to control what page you're on. Some endpoints allow the use of a `perpage` URL Parameter to specify how many results to show per page, though this is rather inconsistent (some endpoints use the current user's settings or only allow the default).
