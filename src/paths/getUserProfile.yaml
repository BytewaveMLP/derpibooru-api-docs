summary: Gets a User's profile.
description: |
  Gets a User's profile by their Name or Id.

  **Warn:** Names take precedence over Ids (A request for `1234` will return the User *named* `1234` instead the User with Id `1234`). **Use the v2 API if you need to get a user by their Id.**

  **Warn:** Non-existant users return a redirect to `/`
